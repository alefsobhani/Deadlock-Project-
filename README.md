Deadlock Project
Introduction
In the complex and dynamic world of operating systems, resource management in a way that optimizes system performance without disruption is of paramount importance. One of the major challenges in this area is a phenomenon called deadlock, which can severely impact system performance. This project is designed to provide a practical and comprehensive understanding of the occurrence, detection, and resolution of deadlocks in operating systems. It consists of three main phases, each addressing a specific aspect of the deadlock problem.
